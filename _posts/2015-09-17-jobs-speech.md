# Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
## About connecting the dots
You cann't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that he dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever, because believeing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.
## About love and lose
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.
## About death
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important,> have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
